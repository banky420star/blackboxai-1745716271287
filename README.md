# Advanced LSTM & DRL Trading Bot

## Project Overview
The Advanced LSTM & DRL Trading Bot is a cutting-edge AI tool designed for automated trading in financial markets. The bot employs advanced machine learning algorithms, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), to make trading decisions based on market data and sentiment analysis.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- Access to news APIs for sentiment analysis
- Appropriate API keys for trading and news sources

### Setup Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-trading-bot-repo.git
   cd your-trading-bot-repo
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure API Keys:**
   Store your API keys securely using environment variables or a `.env` file. Example:
   ```bash
   export EXCHANGE_API_KEY="your_exchange_api_key"
   export EXCHANGE_SECRET_KEY="your_exchange_secret_key"
   export NEWS_API_KEY="your_news_api_key"
   ```

5. **Run Setup Scripts:**
   To set up your environment and required configurations, follow the setup scripts provided in the `scripts` directory.

## Usage

### Running the Bot
To run the trading bot, execute:
```bash
python3 src/main.py
```
This will train the model if no saved model exists, then start trading.

### Testing
To verify all components of the bot, you can run the test script:
```bash
python3 test_bot.py
```

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze financial news using the FinBERT model to gauge market sentiment.
- **Risk Management:** Implement strategies to manage risk effectively.
- **Technical Indicators:** Utilizes a wide range of technical indicators to enhance trading decisions.
- **Real-time Trading:** Execute trades in real-time based on model predictions.
- **User Dashboard:** A simple web interface to monitor trading metrics and bot status.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following libraries, as specified in `requirements.txt`:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `loguru`
- `torch`
- `transformers`
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- Other standard libraries (`os`, `sys`, `datetime`, etc.)
